      You as Data Controller agree that Simple File Upload may engage third-party Sub-processors to provide the Services and such Sub-processors may access personal data, and appoint additional levels of Sub-processors, only for purposes of providing the services Simple File Upload retained them to provide and not for any other purpose.

      Simple File Upload shall give you prior written notice of the appointment of any new Sub-processor, including full details of the Processing to be undertaken by the Sub-processor. If, within 14 days of receipt of that notice, you notify Simple File Upload in writing of any objections (on reasonable grounds) to the proposed appointment, then
      Simple File Upload shall work with you in good faith to make available a commercially reasonable change in the provision of the Services which avoids the use of that proposed Sub-processor; and
      where such a change cannot be made within 14 days from Simple File Upload's receipt of your notice, notwithstanding anything in the Agreement, you may by written notice to Simple File Upload with immediate effect terminate the Agreement to the extent that it relates to the Services which require the use of the proposed Sub-processor.

      <h2 class="font-bold pt-5">Record Keeping</h2>
      Simple File Upload shall, in relation to any Personal Data processed in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with the Data Protection Legislation where applicable.

      <h2 class="font-bold pt-5">Security Breach Management and Notification</h2>
      If Blue Cat Reports becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed in the course of the provision of the Services or any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing of the Personal Data (“Security Breach”), Simple File Upload will promptly:
      (and in any event within 72 hours of becoming aware of the Security Breach) notify you of the Security Breach;

      follow appropriate policies and procedures to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Breach.
      You as the Data Controller agree that an unsuccessful Security Breach attempt will not be subject to Section 7.1 above. An unsuccessful Security Breach attempt is one that results in no unauthorized access to the Data Controller's Personal Data or to the Services storing such Personal Data, and may include, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls or edge servers, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, packet sniffing (or other unauthorized access to traffic data that does not result in access beyond IP addresses or headers) or similar incidents.
      Notification(s) of Security Breaches, if any, will be delivered to one or more of your business, technical or administrative contacts by any means Simple File Upload selects, including via email. It is the your sole responsibility to ensure you maintain accurate contact information on Simple File Upload's support systems at all times.
      Simple File Upload's report of and/or response to a Security Breach under this Section will not be construed as an admission by Simple File Upload to fault or liability with respect to the Security Breach.

      <h2 class="font-bold pt-5">Deletion of Customer Data</h2>
      On completion of the provision of the Services or the termination of the Agreement for any reason or expiry of its term, Simple File Upload will securely delete or destroy or, if directed in writing by you, return and not retain, all or any Personal Data related to this Agreement in its possession or control, except for one copy that it may retain and use for such period as is reasonable not exceeding 2 years soleley for (a) audit purposes or (b) for recordkeeping and legal compliance obligations or where electronic or offsite back-up or archiving systems contain copies of the data.
      If any law, regulation, or government or regulatory body requires Simple File Upload to retain any documents or materials that Simple File Upload would otherwise be required to return or destroy, it will notify you in writing of that retention requirement, giving details of the documents or materials that it must retain, the legal basis for retention, and establishing a specific timeline for destruction once the retention requirement ends.
