        Privacy Policy
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 sm:text-lg text-gray-900 ">
      Your privacy is critically important to us. At Simple File Upload, we have a few fundamental principles:
      <ul class="text-left">
        <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>

        <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>

        <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>

        <li>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles. By visiting the Simple File Upload website, registering with Simple File Upload, or using any Simple File Upload services, you are accepting and agree to comply with this policy. The column on the right provides a short explanation of the privacy policy and is not legally binding.

We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

              Legal and regulatory requirements: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
              We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Simple File Upload, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
              In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Simple File Upload goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
              We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.
              We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.

              If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

              We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.
