The Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Storage:
Is It Right for You?

We use the cloud every day to save cute photos of our pets and access important documents for work. But, do we understand where this data is being stored? Is it magic?

What is cloud storage? 

The cloud refers to a network of remote data servers that are accessible anywhere, anytime via the internet. These data servers are located in data centers across the world. Data centers are centralized repositories that house computing and support equipment. This equipment includes servers, external storage, and networking systems. Data centers operate 24/7. 

Cloud storage may consist of one or many data servers. A cloud service provider manages and maintains these servers. Although you can’t physically access the cloud, it is always accessible virtually.

When you save a file to the cloud, it is stored on these remote data servers instead of your computer's hard drive. It is then accessible to you (and only you) on any of your devices at any time.

Five advantages of cloud storage

Cost: 
Public cloud storage eliminates the costs of in-house data server hardware. This means no need to pay for expensive storage infrastructure that you may or may not use in the future. Less hardware also means more energy cost savings. It’s pricey to operate this equipment continuously at high speeds and keep it cool with necessary cooling technology. It also eliminates the personnel costs associated with the management and maintenance of in-house infrastructure. A cloud service provider will handle everything for you.

Scalable Storage: 
Cloud storage provides scalable storage options for users. It’s easy to upgrade or downgrade your storage space as your needs change over time. The cloud also never runs out of space. Your storage needs will always be able to be met no matter how your organization evolves. Cloud storage space is also provided on a pay-per-use or subscription basis. This means that you only pay for the storage space that you need at that time.

Accessibility: 
Cloud storage is accessible 24/7 from any device with an internet connection. No need to be stuck in your cubicle anymore, you can now work from your favorite coffee shop. Additionally, cloud storage provides authorized users access to the same data and applications. This promotes synchronization. Changes made on the cloud update and save across all devices for all authorized users. Gone are the days of printing hard copy documents or searching for a file on a disorganized hard drive. Cloud storage has made it possible to store and share files with the click of a button. This promotes efficient collaboration and workflow consistency within organizations.

Recovery: 
Cloud storage provides data redundancy. This means that your data is saved across many data servers. This protects your data if one server crashes. Cloud storage can also be used as a backup system to your local computer hard drive. In the event of a local hardware failure, your data will still be safe and available on the cloud.  

Security: 
Advanced security is the biggest advantage of cloud storage. Cloud service providers provide various virtual security measures. These may include multi-factor authentication processes, firewalls, and data encryption. These service providers are also responsible for providing security measures at their data centers. These security measures may include video surveillance, limited access to authorized staff, and security staff. With these enhanced security measures, you can be confident that your data is safe.

Five disadvantages of cloud storage

Network Connectivity: 
To access cloud storage, you need a strong internet connection. An internet outage or slow internet connection may mean lost time and money. 

Complicated Set-Up: 
Some cloud storage applications are easy to use like iCloud or DropBox. However, it can be time-consuming and complicated to set-up cloud storage on your own without the help from an IT Department. There are IAM credentials to set-up and bucket CORS to configure, and it can feel overwhelming even for the most seasoned developer. 

Lack of Control: 
A third-party vendor manages and maintains cloud storage. Thus, you may not have as much control over your data as you would with an in-house storage system. You won’t have physical access to the data servers storing your information. Additionally, you will be limited to the storage structure provided by the cloud service provider. This may be an issue for organizations with complicated storage requirements. 

Extended Downtime: 
Since cloud storage uses remote data servers, there is always the risk of extended downtime. There may be local power outages or security breaches that are out of your control. These issues are the responsibility of the service provider (not you) to remedy. 

Privacy Concerns: 
Cloud storage involves allowing a third-party vendor access to confidential data that would otherwise remain in-house. Additionally, the vendor will be responsible for handling any security risks. This is why it’s important to research your cloud storage options and buy from a reputable company. 

Is cloud storage right for you?

The short answer is that the user benefits of cloud storage typically outweigh the risks. Cloud storage provides convenient and cost-effective data storage solutions for individuals and organizations.
