excerpt: In rails versions prior to 6.1, Active Storage only served files from
  an expiring URL that redirected to the selected service. This made it
  impossible to serve the files via a CDN. There were many workarounds to this
  problem, and fortunately Rails introduced the new proxy features for serving
  files from Active Storage in Rails 6.1
