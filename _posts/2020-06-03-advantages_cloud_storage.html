      <h2>What is cloud storage?</h2>
        <p> The cloud refers to a network of remote data servers that are accessible anywhere, anytime via the internet. These data servers are located in data centers across the world. Data centers are centralized repositories that house computing and support equipment. This equipment includes servers, external storage, and networking systems. Data centers operate 24/7. 

        Cloud storage may consist of one or many data servers. A cloud service provider manages and maintains these servers. Although you can’t physically access the cloud, it is always accessible virtually.

        When you save a file to the cloud, it is stored on these remote data servers instead of your computer's hard drive. It is then accessible to you on any of your devices at any time.
      </p>
      <h2> Five benefits of cloud storage</h2>
      <h3>Cost:</h3>
      <p> Public cloud storage eliminates the costs of in-house data server hardware. This means no need to pay for expensive storage infrastructure that you may or may not use in the future. Less hardware also means more energy cost savings. It’s pricey to operate this equipment continuously at high speeds and keep it cool with necessary cooling technology. It also eliminates the personnel costs associated with the management and maintenance of in-house infrastructure. A cloud service provider will handle everything for you.</p>

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p> Cloud storage is accessible 24/7 from any device with an internet connection. No need to be stuck in your cubicle anymore, you can now work from your favorite coffee shop. Additionally, cloud storage provides authorized users access to the same data and applications. This promotes synchronization. Changes made on the cloud update and save across all devices for all authorized users. Gone are the days of printing hard copy documents or searching for a file on a disorganized hard drive. Cloud storage has made it possible to store and share files with the click of a button. This promotes efficient collaboration and workflow consistency within organizations.</p>

      <h3>Recovery:</h3>
      <p> Cloud storage provides data redundancy. This means that your data is saved across many data servers. This protects your data if one server crashes. Cloud storage can also be used as a backup system to your local computer hard drive. In the event of a local hardware failure, your data will still be safe and available on the cloud. </p>

      <h3>Security:</h3>
      <p> Cloud service providers are responsible for providing security measures at their data centers. These security measures may include video surveillance, limited access to authorized staff, and security staff. With these enhanced security measures, you can be confident that your data is safe.</p>
